# INX-Faucet

[![Go](https://github.com/iotaledger/inx-faucet/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/iotaledger/inx-faucet/actions/workflows/build.yml)

INX-Faucet allows users to provide a faucet for testing networks. The faucet maintains its own wallet and can distribute funds over a simple API endpoint and a generic frontend.

## Version compatibility
* `1.x` versions are compatible with Stardust and [HORNET 2.x](https://github.com/iotaledger/hornet)
* `2.x` versions should be used with IOTA 2.0 and [iota-core](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota-core).

## Setup
We recommend not using this repo directly but using our pre-built [Docker images](https://hub.docker.com/r/iotaledger/inx-faucet) together with our [Docker setup](https://wiki.iota.org/hornet/how_tos/using_docker/).

You can find the corresponding documentation in the [IOTA Wiki](https://wiki.iota.org/hornet/inx-plugins/faucet/welcome/).
